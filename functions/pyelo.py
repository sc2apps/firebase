    This sets the K-factor used to determine how dynamic the Elo system is at responding to change. High values lead to larger

    In chess, K ranges anywhere from 10 to 40, depending on the rating organization and professional status of the players.

        teamB and teamBScore are the same format as teamA.
        homeAdvA is an optional flag for whether teamA has a home advantage. 1 means a home game, -1 means an away game, and 0 is a neutral location (default).
        homeAdvB is an optional flag for teamB's home advantage and follows the same format as above.
        mov stands for Margin of Victory, and is an optional flag for whether to take into account the size of the victory. 1 means yes, 0 means no (default).
            You would use 0 for chess, and probably 1 for games such as basketball, football/soccer, etc.

        This sets the amount, in Elo points, that a home-advantage team is expected to have.
        In chess, there is no well known home team advantage. 
        For other sports, set homeAdvAmt equal to your K-factor (default: 20) times the number of game points advantage.
            In basketball, this might be 60 Elo (20 * 3 baskets = 60 Elo)
            This is an inexact science, so results may vary.
